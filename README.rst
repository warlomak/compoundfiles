compoundfiles
=============

A pure Python library for reading, writing, and editing Microsoft's
Compound File Binary (CFB) format (also known as OLE Compound Documents),
used in legacy Microsoft Office files, certain media systems, and scientific applications.

The library supports Python 3.2+ through Python 3.13.2 (Python 2 support has been dropped in this fork).
It emphasizes correctness, performing extensive validity checks on opened files.
By default, non-fatal errors trigger warnings, which developers can manage via Python's ``warnings`` module.

New Features
============

* **Full Writing Support**: Create new compound files with a compliant Red-Black tree directory structure.
* **Editing Support**: Rename, delete, or add streams and storages in existing files.
* **Enhanced Validation**: Detect and handle corrupted or non-standard files more reliably.
* **Improved Memory Management**: Optimized for large files and MiniFAT streams.
* **Better Compatibility**: Handles edge cases and differences between CFB versions.
